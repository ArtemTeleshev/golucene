/*
BytesRefHash is a special purpose hash map like data structure
optimized for BytesRef instances. BytesRefHash maintains mappings of
byte arrays to ids (map[[]byte]int) sorting the hashed bytes
efficiently in continuous storage. The mapping to the id is
encapsulated inside BytesRefHash and is guaranteed to be increased
for each added BytesRef.

Note: The maximum capacity BytesRef instance passed to add() must not
be longer than BYTE_BLOCK_SIZE-2. The internal storage is limited to
2GB total byte storage.
